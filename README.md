# rus-reg-80-regions

In this short example, I show how to combine several polygons, in particular, to combine the boundaries of the Arkhangelsk Region and the Nenets Autonomous District, as well as the Tyumen Region with the Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Districts. This may be useful for spatial analysis, as there are indicators that are not calculated separately for autonomous districts.
